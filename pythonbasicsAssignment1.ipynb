        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular\n",
        "   - Python is interpreted(code is executed line by line) programming language\n",
        "     which is easily readable and understandable.\n",
        "     it is popular due to various reasons\n",
        "     * has multiple librairies (numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc) which makes coding\n",
        "       easier it also have various kinds of framework (Django)\n",
        "     *It is a versitile language(means can be used for data science, web developement, Automation)\n",
        "     * easy syntax which is good for beginners to learn\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "   - Interpreter refers to executing code line by line which means in tranlates\n",
        "     it to machine code whereas in c/c++ it reads whole code and then translates\n",
        "     it to machine code and then executes it. Interpreter helps in telling error\n",
        "     easily since the code is executed line by line.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "   - pre - defined keyword means which are reserved and can't be used as variable\n",
        "     name or function name.(if,else,while,import)\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "   - No , keywords can't be used/declared as variable name. If we do so we will\n",
        "     run into a syntax error.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        "   - Mutalibity states that we can make changes in the data set but it should be only\n",
        "    (List,set)\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "   - List is muttable because is is created for random collection (it is dynamic) whereas the\n",
        "     tuple is created to store fix values or facts and which is only read only values\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "   - \"==\" is used to check the equalities between to inputs\n",
        "    (a = [\"Akash\"]\n",
        "     b = [\"Akash\"]\n",
        "     print(a == b)  # True (values are equal)\n",
        "     print(a is b)  # False (different memory locations) # this statement can only\n",
        "     turn to true when we also assign b as a because then it will have same memory allocation )\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "   - Logical operators are and,or,not ('and' returns true when both operands are true,\n",
        "     'or' returns true when one operands is true, 'not' returns true when the operands are false. )\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "  - type casting refers to converting one data type to another data type.(int to float)\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "    - implicit type casting pythons converts it automatically\n",
        "     # Implicit Casting\n",
        "     num_int = 10\n",
        "     num_float = 5.5\n",
        "     result = num_int + num_float  # 15.5 (int to float automatically)\n",

        "     # Explicit Casting\n",
        "     num_str = \"100\"\n",
        "     num_int = int(num_str) # manual conversion of string to int\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "    -purpose of condtional statement is when we have multiple condtitions to execcute\n",
        "     where either one is true or false (it can be perfomed using if,else,elif)\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work\n",
        "    -eilf staemnet works when if condtion is turned to be false and it is used\n",
        "     to when we have multiple condtions to execcute\n",
        "     where either one is true or false (it can be perfomed using if,else,elif)\n",
        "     age = 18\n",
        "      if age < 18:\n",
        "       print(\"Minor\")\n",
        "      elif age == 18:\n",
        "       print(\"Exactly 18\")\n",
        "      else:\n",
        "       print(\"Adult\")\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "    - for loop is used for a sequence or a fixed condition\n",
        "      whereas while loop is used to execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    - while loop is suitable for asking otp, password , Atm pin it will keep\n",
        "      asking until or unless a user enters the correct otp or password\n",
        "      and in for loop it will allow us for limited attempt (which is great for security purpose)\n",
